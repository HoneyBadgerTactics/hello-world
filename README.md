Hola Humanos, 
This is HBT. I'm here because I've been wanting to learn to code for like 5 years but thought I was too dumb to learn. Well, guess what? I'm not. I taught myself HTML and CSS, and now I'm learning Python. I love Halloween and food. I love dancing, sci-fi, fantasy, and Selena. Don't talk to me if you don't "believe in climate change" and think COVID is a hoax. You make me sad. Ok bye.
